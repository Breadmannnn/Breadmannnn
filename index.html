        <h2>The Top Three Co-op Games</h2>
            <p>These games have won the top three spots on my list and have been so much fun that they have taken <em>hundreds of hours</em> of my free time. 
                They can all be played solo, however co-op enhances the experience and is what kept me hooked on them.

                    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/" target="_blank">Deep Rock</a> is a 1-4 player video game about venturing into a cave environment and doing odd tasks. There are 4 different classes with their own unique playstyles.
                    <br> 
                    Here are all the mission types:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mining Expedition</strong> (mining a certain amount of Morkite)</li>
                        <li><strong>Egg Hunt</strong> (Mining into the bug nests and depositing the eggs)</li>
                        <li><strong>On-site Refining</strong> (Calling down extracters and building pipelines to extract liquid Morkite)</li>
                        <li><strong>Salvage Operation</strong> (Repairing smaller M.U.L.E's and then repairing the broken drop pod in order to escape)</li>
                        <li><strong>Point Extraction</strong> (Mining a certain amount of Aquarqs and depositing them into the central mining platform)</li>
                        <li><strong>Escort Duty</strong> (Escorting a Drilldozer to the Heartstone and holding out against waves of enemies while repairing the dozer)</li>
                        <li><strong>Elimination</strong> (Destroying cocoons and then fighting one of the bosses that summon afterwards)</li>
                        <li><strong>Industrial Storage</strong> (Connecting hacking pods to three stations and then fighting a boss in the center of the map afterwards)</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    The reason the caves are mostly random is because there are certain rooms and hallways built by the devolpers and then the computer randomly combines these levels.
                    <br>
                    However there is lots of replayability to the game because of how much customization is in the game. 
                    Each class has 4 unlockable weapons with a dozen or more weapon mods that can vary from a small upgrade to drastically changing how the weapon is used.

        <div class="center-img"><img src="img/mhw-image.jpg" alt="Promotional art of Monster Hunter World" width="854" height="480"/></div>
        <h5>From <a href="https://wallpaperaccess.com/mhw">WallpaperAccess</a> and used for educational purposes.</h5>

        <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/582010/Monster_Hunter_World/" target="_blank">Monster Hunter World</a> has a wide roster of large monsters (71 large monsters however half of them are subspecies that look visually similar but have a slight or major attack pattern changes)
        <br>There are fourteen different weapons with varying levels of complexity to their movesets:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Great Sword</strong> (slow hitting with huge damage scaling for compensation)</li>
            <li><strong>Long Sword</strong> (endless attacking since you can use your counter attack after half your moveset)</li>
            <li><strong>Sword and Shield</strong> (easy to pick up and very quick attacks, so very easy to apply elemental/status damage)</li>
            <li><strong>Dual Blades</strong> (two swords no shield, always on the attack with the best dodges in the game, however stamina drains in order to access the dodges)</li>
            <li><strong>Hammer</strong> (comparable to great sword, however slightly faster and applies blunt damage and even KO damage if you hit the head of a monster)</li>
            <li><strong>Hunting Horn</strong> (modified hammer that can play songs through different attacks, these songs can apply a wide variety of benefits to anyone near the hunting horn)</li>
            <li><strong>Lance</strong> (best shield in the game at the cost of having the worst "dodges" in the game, lance can only hop half the distance of a dodge-roll)</li>
            <li><strong>Gunlance</strong> (similar to lance but has shelling attacks that deal a set amount of damage so you don't have to the monsters weakspots)</li>
            <li><strong>Switch Axe</strong> (semi-fast axe mode that builds up charge for slow hard hitting sword mode, very good raw damage or elemental damage)</li>
            <li><strong>Charge Blade</strong> (sword mode charges axe mode, very good once you get some core skills to easily counter attack anything in the game)</li>
            <li><strong>Insect Glaive</strong> (send out a bug that collects 1 of 3 extracts from different monster parts, collecting all 3 increases damage and improves certain movesets, also has air mobility)</li>
            <li><strong>Light Bowgun</strong> (ranged weapons play very differently and require crafting different ammo types to deal significant damage)</li>
            <li><strong>Heavy Bowgun</strong> (slower version of light bowgun but with higher damage potential in the late game)</li>
            <li><strong>Bow</strong> (the simplest ranged weapon to learn before you try bowguns, learn how to perfectly space yourself to hit critical range damage and optimal monster parts to aim for)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Playing this game requires some learning curve, so if you find yourself with some free time you may like Monster Hunter World. It's very fun to learn the movesets of every weapon, after I completed the story with Charge Blade,
            I ended up learning every melee weapon to some extent (I even learned the basics of bow). One warning is that playing the <u>story</u> missions in multiplayer is very slow and clunky, the host must watch the cutscene before others can join.
            However if you are grinding for a certain armor set or armor piece, there are missions called "optional quests" or "investigations" which are very easy and fluid to join. 
            The end game bosses are also very fun to play with others or you could send an "emergency SOS" which just allows anyone to join your mission (makes your session public for one mission).

<!--SECTION FOUR (Payday 2)-->
    <section>
        <div id="payday"><h3>Payday 2</h3></div>
        <div class="center-img"><img src="img/pd2-image.jpg" alt=""/></div>
        <h5>From <a href="https://www.wallpaperflare.com/payday-payday-2-wallpaper-gdcnj">Wallpaperflare</a> and used for educationl purposes.</h5> 
        <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/218620/PAYDAY_2/" target="_blank">Payday 2</a> is a Co-op heisting game with a wide variety of guns, perks, card decks, and heists. It is very fun because unlike other horde shooters, in Payday every enemy shoots back making the game play very differently.
            With the wide variety of perks and card decks there is certainly a playstyle for anyone to have fun with. There are 6 difficulties to choose from and around 66+ heists to choose from with some cool environments.
            This game is a very fun co-op experience with your friends and the nature of the video game allows tons of funny moments to be had.
            <br>
            Here are the options you can buy on Steam:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Payday 2</li>
                <li>Payday 2: Crude Awakening Bundle</li>
                <li>Payday 2: Legacy Collection Bundle</li>
                <li>Payday 2: Silk Road & City of Gold Collection</li>
                <li>Payday 2: Hostile Takeover Bundle</li>
            </ul>
        <p>I recommend that at least one person buys the Legacy Collection Bundle as that has the most amount of heists and when Payday goes on sale this bundle is usually really cheap, I think I bought it for $10.
            The way multiplayer works is that the <strong>host can launch any heist that they own</strong> and then invite their friends to it, so in other words only one person needs to buy the heists. However some guns are locked behind DLC,
            so if you do end up enjoying the heists then consider looking into the DLC options that you may be interested in.
            <br>
            Recently Payday 2 has added crossplay between two popular gaming launchers, Steam and Epic Games Launcher. The reason I mention this is that when they <em>tried to implement crossplay</em> it messed up the random multiplayer lobbies.
            My friends and I are still able to play however we only got the game to work if we both had the game without any mods (I'm sure if we had the same exact mods it would also work). So be warned if you buy the game and try to play in online public lobbies,
            your experience may not be very positive.
